ABSTRACT 
The Local Agricultural Office (LAO) in Goa, Partido, Camarines Sur, has carried out 
several agricultural projects in the barangays of Matacla, Digdigon, and Hiwacloy to assist 
local farmers and raise agricultural output. Through an analysis of important elements like the 
difficulties faced during implementation, the communication tactics used by the LAO, and 
the programs' overall effects on the farming community, this study assessed the efficacy of 
these initiatives. Using semi-structured interviews with ten local registered farmers, the study 
used a qualitative research approach to obtain in-depth perspectives. Although the LAO used 
various communication techniques, such as face-to-face farmer encounters, community 
gatherings, and other outreach techniques, the results showed that several obstacles prevented 
these initiatives from being fully effective. Among the biggest issues noted are lack of 
funding, which restricts the program's operational scope, and technical issues that make it 
harder to disseminate knowledge and adapt contemporary farming methods. Agricultural 
extension services' effectiveness and reach are affected by these limitations. The study 
showed that agricultural programs have improved farmers' livelihoods and crop output 
despite these challenges. Recipients recognize that LAO programs have improved farming 
practices, resource accessibility, and total agricultural productivity. However, the study 
suggests enhancing stakeholder relationships through communication, improving 
communication techniques to guarantee better information flow, and more effective 
transactions in allocating resources to further increase the success of these efforts. The LAO 
can enhance program execution, optimize outreach efficacy, and offer the farming community 
more significant assistance by tackling these issues.

Introduction 
The growth of the farming industry, especially in rural areas, greatly depends on the 
execution of local agricultural initiatives. The main objective of this study is to assess how 
well the Local Agricultural Office's programs serve farmers. The outreach program under 
consideration specifically offers several support channels for farmers who are enrolled with 
authorized cooperatives and the Registry System for the Basic Sectors in Agriculture 
(RSBSA). 

One of the important initiatives is a Loan with low interest (Pautang na may 
mababang interest), which is supported by the Development Bank of the Philippines and 
Land Bank and provides low-interest loans to cooperatives and farmers. Furthermore, the 
Department of Agriculture-Philippine Rice Research Institute (DA-PhilRice) distributes 
(Libreng Dekalidad na binhing palay), as part of the program. Additionally, Da-ati, 
DA-PhilRice, DA-PHilMech, and TESDA provide (Libreng training at mga babasahin), for 
farmers and their dependents. Additionally, through DA-PHilMech, local government 
entities, farmers' associations, and cooperatives receive (Libreng makinaryang pansaka). This 
outreach program is designed to address the needs of farmers and improve their productivity 
and livelihoods by offering financial aid, quality inputs, knowledge, and modern technology. 
Even if these support programs are all-inclusive, several obstacles prevent them from 
being implemented effectively. A major problem is the lack of accessibility and 
understanding among farmers, especially those in rural areas. It's possible that some farmers 
need to be Registry System for the Basic Sectors in Agriculture, registered or have access to 
the information they need regarding these initiatives. Furthermore, reports of inefficiencies 
and bureaucratic delays in the loan, seed, and machinery distribution process have left the 
beneficiaries frustrated. 

Gaps in technical and financial literacy could lead to underuse of the available 
resources. According to data from earlier studies, there is a need for improvement in outreach 
and delivery systems, as evidenced by the fact that only 80% of registered farmers had 
successfully accessed at least one kind of support from these programs. 

Objectives 
Generally, this study aims to explore the communication strategies, challenges, and 
implementation of outreach programs by the Local Agricultural Office. 
Specifically, this study aims to:  
1. Explore the communication strategies and tools employed by the Local Agricultural 
Office in the implementation of Agricultural Programs. 
2. Explore the challenges encountered in implementing the outreach Programs. 

Methodology 
Research Design. This study used the qualitative method to investigate the 
effectiveness of communication strategies utilized by the Local Agriculture Office to improve 
agricultural outreach. The purpose is to learn about the perspectives, experiences, and 
insights of key stakeholders, notably rice farmers and agricultural office staff, regarding the 
communication techniques and strategies used.  
To collect detailed qualitative data, the study was used on in-depth interviews. These 
strategies are appropriate for investigating different points of view, encouraging open-ended 
responses, and allowing for in-depth examination of subjects. 
Participants. The participants in this study were rice farmers from Goa in Partido, 
with a target sample size of ten (10), who had previously participated in or profited from 
outreach initiatives and were carefully selected to participate in the study.  The sample 
included a variety of farms, both small and large-scale operations.  The study included 
farmers from diverse scales to capture a wide range of agricultural approaches and resource 
levels.  In addition, male and female farmers were represented to ensure a balanced 
perspective on gender-specific agricultural experiences and concerns.  This technique was 
intended to provide a comprehensive assessment of how outreach activities benefited various 
groups within the farming community, taking into account factors such as farm size, gender, 
and farming experience.  

Key individuals, such as extension workers and communication specialists, were 
extensively relied on to create and implement outreach campaigns.  These individuals had 
firsthand knowledge and experience in the development and deployment of communication 
techniques.  By participating in the research or assessment process, they could provide 
institutional insight into the efficacy and limits of outreach programs.  Their participation was 
critical since they were in charge of contacting target audiences, including farmers, and could 
provide feedback on how well these methods aligned with organizational goals and farmer 
needs. 

Data Gathering Procedures. In an official letter, the researchers told the Office of 
Agriculture about their experiment and requested their help.  Farmers were sent letters 
confirming that their participation would remain confidential.  The local agriculture office 
worked with the researchers to find possible interviewees and send invitation letters.  
Semi-structured, in-depth interviews with agriculture office personnel and rice farmers were 
performed to collect a variety of opinions and thoughts.  The interviews focused on farmers' 
understanding, opinions, and experiences with the office's agricultural communication 
techniques.  Discussions centered on the strategies' perceived utility, accessibility, and general 
effectiveness.  Farmers were encouraged to express their ideas and provide detailed feedback, 
which helped the office measure the impact and efficacy of its outreach activities. 
In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted with key personnel of the 
Local Agriculture Office, such as communication experts and extension workers.  The 
interviews focused on their roles and responsibilities in developing and implementing 
communication strategies, as well as the challenges they faced in successfully reaching 
farmers. The participants' responses were then coded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed.  
This process ensured that significant trends and insights were derived from the collected data, 
allowing for a full evaluation of current outreach programs. 

Data Gathering Instruments. To examine the effectiveness of communication 
tactics in agricultural outreach, the researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with 
agricultural office workers as well as in-depth interviews with rice farmers.  Interviews with 
farmers were done to learn more about their perspectives on communication tactics, the 
utility of various technologies, how well they suited their needs, the obstacles they faced, and 
suggestions for improvement.  Semi-structured staff interviews focused on the planning, 
execution, and evaluation of communication methods, emphasizing their benefits and 
drawbacks, as well as recommendations for strengthening outreach programs.  To ensure a 
complete understanding of how these tactics worked in real-world circumstances, both 
methods were supplemented with field notes and audio recordings to capture additional 
observations. 


Data Analysis 
Coding Technique. To extract significant insights from the obtained data, this study's 
qualitative data analysis used a systematic coding method.  Initially, open coding was 
employed, with transcripts from in-depth interviews being rigorously analyzed to identify 
relevant subjects and categories.  This step concentrated on essential terms about 
communication tactics, farmer experiences, and outreach effectiveness, such as the numerous 
communication approaches employed, farmer perspectives, and communication impediments.  
Following that, axial coding grouped these initial codes into bigger categories, resulting in 
links between different concepts.  Types of communication (verbal, visual, and digital), 
perceived efficacy, gender and farm size inclusion, and outreach problems were identified. 
Coding concentrated on the major categories and created a story that demonstrated 
how they related to one another.  Taking notes during the coding process helped to chronicle 
thoughts and observations, guide the study, and identify developing patterns.  Following the 
establishment of these codes, thematic analysis found important themes in the data set.  We 
had in-depth discussions about communication awareness, the perceived effectiveness of 
communication techniques, communication hurdles, gender-specific viewpoints, and 
change-related thinking. 

Thematic Analysis. This thematic analysis gave a complete grasp of how 
communication approaches impacted agricultural outreach by looking into how awareness 
drove perceived effectiveness and identified barriers to engagement.  Furthermore, 
triangulation was employed to compare farmers' ideas with those of Local Agriculture Office 
personnel, boosting the validity of the findings.  Finally, our thorough coding and theme 
analysis technique resulted in specific recommendations for improving communication 
strategies and agricultural outreach methods. 

Results and Discussion 
According to the interviews with Participants 1 and 2, conventional methods of 
communication in the agriculture industry are most commonly used, such as letters and text 
messages. Participant 1 underlined that letters are used to formalize the dissemination of 
information to farmers, whereas text messages are used for follow-ups. This dual method 
enables both formal documentation and immediate communication, which is critical for 
providing timely updates on agricultural initiatives and resources. 
Communication strategies and tools used in the implementation of Agricultural Programs 
Use of Traditional Communication. Formal communication strategies, like letters, 
were frequently cited as a dependable means of guaranteeing reach and clarity. Informing 
farmers about meetings, seminars, and other resources was made possible via text messages, 
which were frequently sent after letters, according to Participant 1. In addition, informal 
communication via social events or word-of-mouth caused confusion because details were 
occasionally misrepresented. These results imply that although informal communication is 
still widely used, formal channels such as letters are necessary for agricultural outreach 
efforts to disseminate accurate and understandable information. 
“Through text, text communication ang ginagamit nindang communication para 
mainform so mga farmers arog ko and letters tapos pag na ano yaon na  ang surat 
ang second follow -up kaitong sa text message.” [Through text, text communication is 
the communication they use to inform farmers like me, and letters are used when that 
happens. The letter is the second follow-up to the text message.]  
According to the study's findings, the Local Agricultural Office mostly employs 
letters and text messages to distribute agricultural information, guaranteeing official 
documentation and timely updates. This supports the idea that agricultural projects are more 
likely to be adopted when there is structured communication. The study also shows that 
conventional word-of-mouth exchanges can occasionally result in false information, 
underscoring the necessity of official, trustworthy channels. All things considered, letters and 
texts are essential for guaranteeing correctness and successful agricultural outreach, even 
though both official and informal contact plays a part in the diffusion process. A relevant 
theory to support these results is the Diffusion of Innovations Theory by Everett Rogers. 
Face-to-Face and Group Announcements. Participant 9 stated that farmers 
primarily learn about available aid via barangay meetings, where local authorities make 
announcements and provide updates.  These conferences provide a formal forum for debating 
agricultural support programs and other community issues.  In addition to meetings, farmers 
learn from informal community talks in which neighbors and fellow farmers share what 
they've heard.  Direct communication from officials ensures that crucial details reach farmers, 
adding clarity and legitimacy to the information.  This combination of institutional and 
informal channels ensures that farmers are aware of potential aid and opportunities. 
“Itong pig sasadya kami ta naaraman mi talaga na ta kung talaga kami kung kaiba 
talaga kami dyan sa makua.” [We're being prepared because we really know that if 
we're really if we're really among those who get it.] 
Farmers rely mostly on barangay meetings, community conversations, and 
government announcements for information about potential aid initiatives.  These events act 
as vital communication channels that connect farmers and government entities.  Participant 9 
emphasizes that face-to-face encounters at these events allow them to directly ask questions 
and determine whether they are eligible for support.  This personalized approach avoids 
misunderstanding and ensures that farmers receive correct information about the available 
subsidies.  Unlike written announcements or social media updates, these in-person techniques 
promote trust and clarity, which are critical in rural areas.  When farmers communicate 
directly with government or community leaders, they are more likely to feel comfortable 
voicing their problems and asking for clarity. Furthermore, these discussions foster a sense of 
inclusion, letting farmers feel acknowledged and heard in the decision-making process.  The 
physical presence of government representatives strengthens the credibility of the information 
delivered, lowering uncertainties and skepticism.  Many farmers still prefer verbal 
communication over written documents, particularly those with poor literacy or access to 
technology.  Finally, these traditional, face-to-face tactics boost farmers' confidence by 
keeping them informed and engaged with aid programs that can enhance their livelihoods. 
Use of Printed Materials.  According to participants 9 and 10, to make sure their 
names are on the lists that are distributed, some farmers go to the barangay hall to look over 
the posted lists.  They can verify through this approach if they qualify for government 
program assistance.  They prevent miscommunications or lost chances for assistance by 
personally confirming the list.  They also have the opportunity to enquire with local 
authorities if they have any questions concerning the distribution of help or if their names are 
missing. 

“Pag so mayo man kaya pig papaisi tapos pa minsan pig papaskil ninda dyan sa 
barangay hall, mag dyan na lang ngaya kamo sa barangay hall hilingon ngaya nindo 
si pangaran nindo kung yaon ta may maabot na tabang na abuno arog kaiyan banhi.” 
[If there is no announcement and sometimes they post it in the barangay hall, just go 
to the barangay hall and check your name if there is any help coming with fertilizer 
like that seed.]  
“Arog kang mga printed na copy yaon dyan si mga lista na igwa ngayang ayuda, 
kaya ang sunod through text. Uruulay halimbawa si saro naka aram duman na igwa 
palan ning kuyan uruistorya.” [Like the printed copies, there are lists that have 
assistance, so the next one is through text. For example, someone knew that there was 
a story.] 

Farmers make the effort to personally review the lists posted at the barangay hall to 
confirm that their names are included and that they are eligible for help.  This proactive 
strategy helps to avoid misunderstandings and missing opportunities linked to aid 
distribution.  Farmers who verify the listings themselves can promptly resolve any concerns 
or anomalies they discover.  If their names are absent or inaccuracies are discovered, 
individuals can contact local officials to clarify and fix the situation.  This direct 
communication encourages transparency and guarantees that farmers' concerns are addressed.  
Furthermore, farmers rely on text messaging and word-of-mouth to be informed about 
announcements and crucial information.  This combination of personal verification and 
community-based information sharing keeps everyone informed while lowering the chance of 
disinformation. 

Digital Communication in Agricultural Programs. Social media platforms like 
Facebook were mentioned as useful tools by some respondents, particularly those with access 
to these platforms, mentioned social media platforms like Facebook as useful tools. 
Participant 4 noted the utility of group chats in disseminating information quickly. However, 
digital platforms are not universally accessible, especially for older farmers or those without 
regular internet access, suggesting that while digital communication can complement other 
methods, it should not be relied upon exclusively. 

“Sa group chat na lang arog kaan, tapos e aano na lang samo e iimpomasyon na lang 
samo sa arog kaini mag duman kamo.” [Just in the group chat like this, then what's up 
with us and we'll just inform each other like this and you'll come.] 
Respondents' use of social media platforms such as Facebook illustrates how well 
these tools suit their requirements for quick and easy information sharing.  This behavior is 
consistent with Blumler and Katz's (1974) Uses and Gratifications Theory (UGT), which 
proposes that people consciously choose media to meet certain needs like keeping informed 
or engaging with others.  According to UGT, media consumption is determined by a person's 
skills and access to technology, which may explain why older farmers use digital platforms 
less frequently.  Many older farmers may face difficulties such as insufficient computer 
literacy or poor internet connectivity, preventing them from fully utilizing these tools. To 
bridge this gap, a combination of digital communication and traditional approaches such as 
face-to-face meetings or printed materials could ensure that critical agricultural information 
reaches a larger audience.  This hybrid approach recognizes that, while social media is 
powerful, it is not universally accessible, particularly for individuals with little technological 
proficiency.  As a result, understanding how different demographics interact with media can 
assist enhance communication tactics, making agricultural initiatives more inclusive and 
effective. 

Challenges in the Implementation of Outreach Programs 
 
 Trust Issues and Misinformation. Participant 1 stated that relying on word-of-mouth 
communication frequently results in disinformation since things might become twisted or 
inflated along the way.  This can lead to confusion among farmers, particularly when it comes 
to comprehending the exact types of agricultural supplies given.  For example, some farmers 
may feel they are receiving inbred seeds when in fact hybrid seeds are being supplied.  Such 
misunderstandings can have an impact on planting selections and overall agricultural 
productivity.  Participant 1 emphasized the importance of better, more dependable 
communication mechanisms to guarantee farmers receive correct, unaltered information. 
 
“Ta pagano ito bagang masabi ka sana itext mo sana si sarong tawo na mayo man 
ning kompletong na information tungkol duman sa pameeting or topic or seminars,oh 
eh anong information hali sa agency minsan sala baga ano arog kaito na ang paapod 
palan is maorient nanaman sa ano sa highbrid huna ninda kaibahan so inbrid oh di 
kaya mas maray ano itong surat.” ["Because it seems like you should have texted 
someone who has complete information about the meeting or topic or seminars, or 
what information comes from the agency. Sometimes, it's like this, that the purpose is 
to orient them again on what is in their hybrid minds, so in hybrid, or maybe this letter 
is better."] 
 
The expression conveys displeasure with how meetings, topics, or seminars are 
communicated, particularly when the material is insufficient or confusing.  It emphasizes that 
depending entirely on text messages might lead to misconceptions because they may omit 
key elements or deliver erroneous information.  To address this issue, the speaker proposes 
sending written notices, such as official letters, to all participants to verify that all information 
is clear and true.  Written notices are more structured and less likely to be misinterpreted than 
quick SMS messages.  The speaker also observes that certain sessions appear to be primarily 
focused on reorienting participants on hybrid-related subjects, meaning that the information 
may be repetitious or unneeded. This finding suggests that if the purpose is simply to refresh 
information, a more direct style of communication may be more effective.  Participants may 
better understand the aim and content of the sessions if information is given in a more 
simplified manner.  Finally, the speaker urges for better, more organized communication to 
enhance the success of these gatherings and seminars. 
Time Management.  According to one participant, farmers frequently struggle to 
balance farm work and outreach efforts.  Many meetings and seminars are organized during 
peak agricultural seasons, such as planting or harvesting, when farmers are the busiest.  This 
timing encourages farmers to prioritize their livelihood above potentially beneficial 
programs, even if they wish to participate.  As a result, they overlook important information 
and tools that could help them improve their farming techniques. 
“Kami sa Co-off busy kami dahil duman sa ano sa pag ano kang paroy tapos mayo 
kami ning ano ning maipadara saro lang ang nagatindir basta itong nagkakaano ang 
schedule tapos minsan ang kumunikasyon is syempre pinapadara baga iyan dae 
taman aram na maabot siya tulos minsan nagaabot sa aga di kulang na si ano 
halimbawa kami sa Co-off ohh ano na kung baga gahol na isay na ang itatao mi igde 
arog kayan yan ang kadalasan arog kaan.” [We at Co-off are busy because of the 
work, and we don't have enough to send. Only one person is managing everything, 
and when the schedule gets tight, sometimes communication is delayed. Of course, 
we send it, but sometimes it doesn't reach on time, and it arrives very early. For 
example, we at Co-off, oh, it's like we're in a hurry to send it, and that's usually how it 
goes.] 
The statement emphasizes how the farmers at Co-off have communication challenges 
due to their hectic schedules.  When only one person handles the flow of information, the 
process becomes slow and inefficient.  As a result, key agricultural updates are delayed, 
potentially affecting farmers' ability to make timely decisions.  Messages can come too early, 
or confusing, or they may never reach their intended receivers.  This communication gap 
might result in misconceptions and missed opportunities for farmers. It emphasizes the need 
for a more dependable and accessible communication infrastructure that can accommodate 
the farmers' erratic schedules.  Furthermore, relying solely on planned communication is 
ineffective when dealing with urgent situations.  Implementing improved means, such as 
mobile technology or multiple connection points, could considerably increase the speed and 
precision with which information is distributed. 
Low Engagement in Digital Platforms. While social media and group chats are used 
for communication, not all farmers are familiar with these platforms. Some rely on their 
children or others to access information on their behalf, limiting their direct engagement with 
digital outreach efforts. As stated by participant 5, “Dae ako tatao mag gamit ning cellphone, 
so aki ko pig pahiling ko na lang.” [I won't know how to use a cell phone, so I just let my 
child show me.] 
The digital divide among farmers is highlighted by this statement, especially the 
difference between those who feel comfortable utilizing technology and those who don't. Not 
all farmers have direct access to social media and group chats, although they offer practical 
ways of exchanging agricultural information. On the other hand, some depend on their kids or 
other people to get and convey information to them. Their personal use of digital 
communication is limited by this dependence, indicating the need for more inclusive 
approaches that serve both conventional and tech-savvy farmers. 
Communication Barriers. According to Participant 1, Many farmers rely on writing 
for official communication, but this method can be slow and sometimes ineffective. Farmers 
also highlighted that information relayed through word of mouth can be inaccurate or 
incomplete. 
“Dapat pag nagdedeseminate kang information, dapat klaro… minsan kasi pag text 
lang, kulang ang impormasyon o minsan sala ang pagkaintindi.” [When 
disseminating information, it should be clear... sometimes, when it's just text, the 
information is lacking or the understanding is sometimes wrong.] 
The statement draws attention to the shortcomings of farmers' conventional means of 
communication. Despite being seen as official, written communication is frequently delayed 
and may not always be successful. Furthermore, partial or inaccurate information may spread 
through word of mouth. Participant 1 highlights the value of communication clarity, pointing 
out that depending only on text messages might occasionally lead to information being 
missed or misinterpreted. This implies that to guarantee that farmers are provided with 
correct and full information regarding agricultural initiatives, more thorough and precise 
communication tactics are required. 
Overcrowding During Distribution. According to Participant 9, aid delivery can 
easily become disorganized, causing confusion among recipients and slowing the process.  
People may fail to comprehend where and when to claim their benefits, resulting in long 
lineups and overcrowding.  This misconception can lead to some people missing out on aid 
entirely, particularly those who are underinformed or physically unable to compete for scarce 
resources.  Effective planning and communication are critical to ensuring that aid is 
distributed properly and efficiently. 
“Ano pagkuyan halimbawa nagkasarabay sabay ang mga nagkukua ning mga abono 
libre gulping tawo nadidipisilan kami ta syempre surusuan minsan mariribok, oo dae 
mo maaaraman kaya ang gibo ning DA pagmay libre, paaramayan kung isay ang 
maamay tas may lista duman nalang magsunod sa number.” [For example, when 
people simultaneously come to get free fertilizer, we struggle because, of course, 
everyone rushes in, and sometimes it gets chaotic. Yes, you wouldn’t know because 
when the DA (Department of Agriculture) gives freebies, people inform each other 
about it. Whoever gets there first gets it, and there’s a list where people just follow 
their number.] 
Overcrowding during help distribution creates tremendous confusion and disturbance, 
making it difficult for both receivers and organizers to handle the process effectively.  The 
 
enormous number of people frequently creates chaotic circumstances in which individuals 
push and shove for their part.  This illness is exacerbated by misunderstanding and poor 
directions, leaving many people wondering where to go or what to do.  As a result, some 
people, particularly those who are ignorant or physically disabled, are left behind or 
altogether excluded from receiving assistance. The lack of sufficient guidelines promotes 
hurrying and impatience, resulting in an unequal workplace.  To avoid such problems, careful 
planning must be implemented to anticipate and regulate huge groups.  Clear and repeated 
announcements are vital for guiding participants and ensuring everyone understands the 
procedure.  Furthermore, organized queuing systems can assist in maintaining order, resulting 
in a smoother, faster, and more equitable distribution for everyone. 

Conclusion

Despite their diversity, the Local Agricultural Office's communication tactics work 
best in places that are easily accessible and where farmers are acclimated to more 
conventional means of contact. However, these programs' reach is limited in places with poor 
infrastructure, including isolated barangays. The personal involvement of local agricultural 
authorities and community leaders has been crucial in breaking down communication 
barriers, notwithstanding certain outreach difficulties. The effectiveness of communication 
campaigns is determined by the nature of the outreach tool and how well it aligns with the 
target audience's skills, such as literacy levels and technological access. 

Recommendations 

It is recommended that the Local Agricultural Office persist in employing a variety of 
communication techniques. It is advised, therefore, that more focus be given to local 
newsletters and Facebook pages, as they have a larger audience, especially in rural areas. 
Giving farmers basic instructions on how to use mobile phones and online platforms for 
agricultural updates would help increase the efficacy of digital communication tools. 
Outreach initiatives would also be improved by ongoing training on digital communication 
strategies for agricultural officers. To improve communication infrastructure in rural 
locations, the Local Agricultural Office should invest more funds in things like better 
transportation for outreach workers and improved internet connectivity.
