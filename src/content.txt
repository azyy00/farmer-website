Challenges in the Implementation of Outreach Programs 
 
  Trust Issues and Misinformation. Participant 1 stated that relying on word-of-mouth 
communication frequently results in disinformation since things might become twisted or 
inflated along the way.  This can lead to confusion among farmers, particularly when it comes 
to comprehending the exact types of agricultural supplies given.  For example, some farmers 
may feel they are receiving inbred seeds when in fact hybrid seeds are being supplied.  Such 
misunderstandings can have an impact on planting selections and overall agricultural 
productivity.  Participant 1 emphasized the importance of better, more dependable 
communication mechanisms to guarantee farmers receive correct, unaltered information. 
 
“Ta  pagano  ito  bagang  masabi  ka  sana  itext  mo sana si sarong tawo na mayo man 
ning kompletong na information tungkol duman sa pameeting or topic or seminars,oh 
eh anong information hali sa agency minsan sala baga ano arog kaito na ang paapod 
palan  is maorient nanaman sa ano sa highbrid huna ninda kaibahan so inbrid oh di 
kaya  mas  maray  ano  itong  surat.”  ["Because it seems like you should have texted 
someone who has complete information about the meeting or topic or seminars, or 
what information comes from the agency. Sometimes, it's like this, that the purpose is 
to orient them again on what is in their hybrid minds, so in hybrid, or maybe this letter 
is better."] 
 
 
 
  The expression conveys displeasure with how meetings, topics, or seminars are 
communicated, particularly when the material is insufficient or confusing.  It emphasizes that 
depending entirely on text messages might lead to misconceptions because they may omit 
key elements or deliver erroneous information.  To address this issue, the speaker proposes 
sending written notices, such as official letters, to all participants to verify that all information 
is clear and true.  Written notices are more structured and less likely to be misinterpreted than 
quick SMS messages.  The speaker also observes that certain sessions appear to be primarily 
focused on reorienting participants on hybrid-related subjects, meaning that the information 
may be repetitious or unneeded. This finding suggests that if the purpose is simply to refresh 
information, a more direct style of communication may be more effective.  Participants may 
better understand the aim and content of the sessions if information is given in a more 
simplified manner.  Finally, the speaker urges for better, more organized communication to 
enhance the success of these gatherings and seminars. 
 
  Time Management.  According to one participant, farmers frequently struggle to 
balance farm work and outreach efforts.  Many meetings and seminars are organized during 
peak agricultural seasons, such as planting or harvesting, when farmers are the busiest.  This 
timing encourages farmers to prioritize their livelihood above potentially beneficial 
programs, even if they wish to participate.  As a result, they overlook important information 
and tools that could help them improve their farming techniques. 
 
“Kami  sa  Co-off  busy  kami  dahil duman sa ano sa pag ano kang paroy tapos mayo 
kami ning ano ning maipadara saro lang ang nagatindir basta itong nagkakaano ang 
schedule  tapos  minsan  ang  kumunikasyon  is  syempre  pinapadara  baga  iyan  dae 
taman  aram  na  maabot  siya  tulos  minsan  nagaabot  sa  aga  di  kulang  na  si  ano 
halimbawa kami sa Co-off ohh ano na kung baga gahol na isay na ang itatao mi igde 
arog  kayan  yan  ang  kadalasan  arog  kaan.” [We at Co-off are busy because of the 
work, and we don't have enough to send. Only one person is managing everything, 
and when the schedule gets tight, sometimes communication is delayed. Of course, 
we  send it, but sometimes it doesn't reach on time, and it arrives very early. For 
example, we at Co-off, oh, it's like we're in a hurry to send it, and that's usually how it 
goes.] 
 
The statement emphasizes how the farmers at Co-off have communication challenges 
due to their hectic schedules.  When only one person handles the flow of information, the 
process becomes slow and inefficient.  As a result, key agricultural updates are delayed, 
potentially affecting farmers' ability to make timely decisions.  Messages can come too early, 
or confusing, or they may never reach their intended receivers.  This communication gap 
might result in misconceptions and missed opportunities for farmers. It emphasizes the need 
for a more dependable and accessible communication infrastructure that can accommodate 
the farmers' erratic schedules.  Furthermore, relying solely on planned communication is 
ineffective when dealing with urgent situations.  Implementing improved means, such as 
mobile technology or multiple connection points, could considerably increase the speed and 
precision with which information is distributed. 
 
  Low Engagement in Digital Platforms. While social media and group chats are used 
for communication, not all farmers are familiar with these platforms. Some rely on their 
children or others to access information on their behalf, limiting their direct engagement with 
digital outreach efforts. As stated by participant 5, “Dae ako tatao mag gamit ning cellphone, 
 
 
so aki ko pig pahiling ko na lang.” [I won't know how to use a cell phone, so I just let my 
child show me.] 
 
  The digital divide among farmers is highlighted by this statement, especially the 
difference between those who feel comfortable utilizing technology and those who don't. Not 
all farmers have direct access to social media and group chats, although they offer practical 
ways of exchanging agricultural information. On the other hand, some depend on their kids or 
other people to get and convey information to them. Their personal use of digital 
communication is limited by this dependence, indicating the need for more inclusive 
approaches that serve both conventional and tech-savvy farmers. 
 
  Communication Barriers. According to Participant 1, Many farmers rely on writing 
for official communication, but this method can be slow and sometimes ineffective. Farmers 
also highlighted that information relayed through word of mouth can be inaccurate or 
incomplete. 
 
“Dapat  pag  nagdedeseminate  kang  information,  dapat  klaro... minsan kasi pag text 
lang,  kulang  ang  impormasyon  o  minsan  sala  ang  pagkaintindi.”  [When 
disseminating  information,  it  should be clear... sometimes, when it's just text, the 
information is lacking or the understanding is sometimes wrong.] 
 
  The statement draws attention to the shortcomings of farmers' conventional means of 
communication. Despite being seen as official, written communication is frequently delayed 
and may not always be successful. Furthermore, partial or inaccurate information may spread 
through word of mouth. Participant 1 highlights the value of communication clarity, pointing 
out  that  depending  only  on  text  messages  might  occasionally  lead  to information being 
missed  or  misinterpreted.  This  implies  that  to  guarantee  that  farmers  are  provided with 
correct  and  full  information  regarding  agricultural initiatives, more thorough and precise 
communication tactics are required. 
 
  Overcrowding During Distribution. According to Participant 9, aid delivery can 
easily become disorganized, causing confusion among recipients and slowing the process.  
People may fail to comprehend where and when to claim their benefits, resulting in long 
lineups and overcrowding.  This misconception can lead to some people missing out on aid 
entirely, particularly those who are underinformed or physically unable to compete for scarce 
resources.  Effective planning and communication are critical to ensuring that aid is 
distributed properly and efficiently. 
 
“Ano pagkuyan halimbawa nagkasarabay sabay ang mga nagkukua ning mga abono 
libre gulping tawo nadidipisilan kami ta syempre surusuan minsan mariribok, oo dae 
mo  maaaraman  kaya  ang  gibo  ning  DA  pagmay  libre,  paaramayan  kung  isay  ang 
maamay  tas  may  lista  duman  nalang  magsunod  sa  number.”  [For example, when 
people  simultaneously  come  to get free fertilizer, we struggle because, of course, 
everyone rushes in, and sometimes it gets chaotic. Yes, you wouldn’t know because 
when the DA (Department of Agriculture) gives freebies, people inform each other 
about it. Whoever gets there first gets it, and there’s a list where people just follow 
their number.] 
 
Overcrowding during help distribution creates tremendous confusion and disturbance, 
making it difficult for both receivers and organizers to handle the process effectively.  The 
 
 
enormous number of people frequently creates chaotic circumstances in which individuals 
push and shove for their part.  This illness is exacerbated by misunderstanding and poor 
directions, leaving many people wondering where to go or what to do.  As a result, some 
people, particularly those who are ignorant or physically disabled, are left behind or 
altogether excluded from receiving assistance. The lack of sufficient guidelines promotes 
hurrying and impatience, resulting in an unequal workplace.  To avoid such problems, careful 
planning must be implemented to anticipate and regulate huge groups.  Clear and repeated 
announcements are vital for guiding participants and ensuring everyone understands the 
procedure.  Furthermore, organized queuing systems can assist in maintaining order, resulting 
in a smoother, faster, and more equitable distribution for everyone.
